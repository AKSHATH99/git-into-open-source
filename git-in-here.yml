    Don't be afraid to jump strait in, it's the best way to learn and great fun too!

    I use React as a library for most of my projects.The tools that I use in most of my projects 
    are VS Code, git and github. Javascript is my favourite language and I absolutely love it.

    I want to get into open source because it fascinates me a lot, how I can contribute in ohters' 
    projects despite being a fresher. The best thing about open source, as its name suggests, is 
    that it is open to all to see the source code, suggest chsnges to it and even make the projects
    better by their contributions. When project initiated by one mind gets the expertise and ideas
    of multiple minds, it always turns into something more fantastic and unique.

   The first go-to resource for learning open source concepts alongside contributing to it is 'GitHub'
   . GitHub provides us convenience for contributing , raising issues and more things. YouTube is 
   also good for learning concepts. Going through documentation gives us a more clear and broad view.
   And lastly supportive friends from any social media platforms who encourages us to go forward. I 
   find these resources really helpful.
